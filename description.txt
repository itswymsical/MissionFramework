Core Systems:
- Complete mission lifecycle management (creation, tracking, completion, rewards)
- Event handler system covering player interactions, combat, NPC dialogue, world events, and environmental triggers
- Mission chaining and branching support
- Objective tracking with multiple concurrent objectives

Tools:
- Dialogue system with character portraits and text sequencing
- Cutscene framework for scripted events
- Mission briefings and debriefings
- Custom UI elements for mission display and tracking

Dev-Friendly:
- Easy mission definition
- Extensive event hooks for custom triggers
- Modular architecture (use what you need, ignore what you don't)

Whether you're building a simple bounty board or a full narrative campaign, MissionFramework handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on content.
